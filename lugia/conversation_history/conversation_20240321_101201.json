Here are a few ways we could improve the UI based on your ideas:\n\nTo allow hiding/showing the preview section: \n- Add a toggle button or checkbox labeled \"Show preview\" above the preview section\n- Clicking it would collapse or expand the preview display\n- This gives users control to hide the preview if they find it distracting or don't need it, while keeping it easily accessible\n\nTo provide a visual cue when creating a new conversation:\n- When the \"New Conversation\" button is clicked, show a loading spinner and text like \"Creating new conversation...\" \n- Once the new empty conversation loads, display a message like \"New conversation created\" that fades out after a few seconds\n- Highlighting the new conversation in the list view would also help draw attention to it\n- These cues would make it very clear to the user that a fresh conversation has started, preventing confusion with the current conversation\n\nThe dropdown idea for showing/hiding the preview is good, as it would keep the interface compact. But a more prominent toggle may be better to ensure discoverability of that option.\n\nLet me know what you think of these suggestions! I'd be happy to elaborate on the reasoning behind them. The goal is to improve the UI in a way that makes key actions clearer while giving users more control over their experience. Looking forward to discussing further.",
